Simple Food Ordering System

Problem Statement

Traditional food ordering processes in small restaurants and cafes often rely on manual methods such as paper-based menus and handwritten orders. This leads to inefficiencies, errors in order taking, difficulty in tracking sales, and a lack of digital records. Customers may also face delays and confusion when placing orders, especially during peak hours. There is a need for a simple, reliable, and user-friendly system that automates the ordering process, maintains accurate records, and provides basic reporting for small-scale food businesses.

Scope of the Project

This project focuses on developing a console-based food ordering system that enables customers to browse a digital menu, add items to a cart, and place orders. The system also allows restaurant staff (admins) to manage the menu by adding or removing items. It tracks all orders, calculates daily sales, and exports order history to a CSV file for further analysis. The system is designed for small restaurants, cafes, or food stalls that do not require advanced features like online payments or delivery tracking. The scope does not include integration with payment gateways, mobile apps, or advanced analytics.
